There are many great cooking Applications available online, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this one. I want to create an recipe storage application so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on cooking something amazing. Not scrolling through webpages.
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a recipe from scratch.
- You should be connected with a community of people who do what you love. :smile:

Of course, no one Application will serve all people since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
